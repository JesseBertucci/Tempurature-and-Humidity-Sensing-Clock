Tempurature and Humidity Sensing Clock

This device displays the date, time, room tempurate, humidity, and the heat index to an LCD display.

The LCD display backlighting intensity is determined by the ambient room lighting. If the user is sleeping with the
lights off, the LCD backlight will dim. If the user turns the room lights on, the LCD backlight intensity will increase.

It uses an Arduino Nano (ATMega328P), a photoresistor, 1602 LCD, DS3231 clock module, DHT11 or DHT22 tempurature and humitidy sensing module,
a potentiometer, two buttons, two 220ohm resistors, and one 10kohm resistor.
