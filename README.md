Tempurature and Humidity Sensing Clock

This device displays the date, time, room tempurate, and humidity to an LCD display inside a 3D printed clock body. 

The LCD display backlighting intensity is determined by the ambient room lighting. If the user is sleeping with the
lights off, the LCD backlight will dim. If the user turns the room lights on, the LCD backlight intensity will increase.

It uses an Arduino Nano (ATMega328P), one photoresistor, one 1602 LCD, one DS3231 clock module, one BME280 tempurature, humitidy, and pressure sensing module, one potentiometer, two buttons, two 220ohm resistors, and one 10kohm resistor.

Solder all components (except the two buttons and the LCD display) to a standard 30 pin solderable breadboard. Breadboard, LCD, and 
two buttons fit inside of 3D printed clock body.
